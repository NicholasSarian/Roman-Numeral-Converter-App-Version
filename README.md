# Roman-Numeral-Converter-App-Version-
This is just like the HTML version of the Roman Numeral Converter but has been made into an application and has been coded using VB.NET.

Before getting started, you will need Visual Studio in order to execute this application because this application was made in Visual Studio.

If you would like to execute this application and see it run in realtime, follow these steps:
1) Hit the green "Clone or download" button then click "Download ZIP"
2) Once downloaded, go to the folder when it's been downloaded (in File Explorer). Right-click on the ZIP folder and hit "Extract All" then hit "Extract". At this point, you are welcome to delete the ZIP folder as you won't need this any more.
3) Open up the folder and there should be another folder labeled "Roman-Numeral-Converter-App-Version--master". Click on the address bar above once and while highlighted, right-click the highlighted text and copy.
4) Open up the start menu and search for and open PowerShell.
5) Type "dir -Path (insert double-quote)" then right-click anywhere inside PowerShell. That will paste the address you copied. Now type "(insert double-quote) -Recurse | Unblock-File". Typing in this command will unblock all of the files within the folder so that you will be able to compile the application and run it. Replace (insert double-quote) with a ". ***Example command: dir -Path "C:\Users\myUserName\Downloads\Roman-Numeral-Converter-App-Version-master" -Recurse | Unblock-File
6) Now open up the folder until you get inside the folder with a bunch of items in it including one folder named "Roman Numeral Converter"
7) Open the "Roman Numeral Converter.sln" file in Visual Studio
8) Once it's been open, click the "Start" button at the top under the "Window" dropdown. This will compile and run the application.
